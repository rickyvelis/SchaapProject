Android Studio Project

Android App I made as part of an Innovation project for my university. 

When sheep happen to get on their back, and their wool is full grown, they might not 
be able to get back up and they die as a result. 

This (concept) app is meant to serve as a monitor to check if sheep are laying on their 
back for too long. This app is meant to be used in combination with an arduino chip + Gyrosensor(MPU6050) 
that is attached to the sheep's back.
